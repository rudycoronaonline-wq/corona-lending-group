If you're a real estate investor, you've probably heard of DSCR loans. Here's what they are and when they make sense.

## What Does DSCR Mean?

DSCR stands for **Debt Service Coverage Ratio**. It's a measure of whether a property's rental income can cover its debt payments (mortgage, taxes, insurance, etc.). Lenders use it to decide if the property can "pay for itself" without relying on your personal income.

## How DSCR Loans Are Different

With a conventional loan, the lender looks at *your* income, credit, and debts. With a DSCR loan, the focus is on the *property*: its rental income versus its expenses. That's why they're popular with investors who own multiple properties or have complex personal income (e.g., self-employed).

## Who Qualifies?

Typically you need a minimum DSCR (e.g., 1.0 or 1.25, meaning rent covers 100% or 125% of the payment). Down payments are often 20–25%. Credit requirements vary by lender. I work with several DSCR programs and can match you to one that fits your portfolio.

## When to Use a DSCR Loan

DSCR loans are ideal when you're buying or refinancing rental property and want to qualify based on cash flow rather than W-2 income. They're also useful when you've hit conventional limits on number of financed properties.
