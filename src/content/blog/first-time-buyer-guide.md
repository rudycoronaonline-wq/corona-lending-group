Buying your first home in Southern California is exciting, but it can feel overwhelming. Here are five things every first-time homebuyer should know before you start.

## 1. Get Pre-Approved First

Before you fall in love with a listing, get pre-approved. Pre-approval tells you exactly how much you can afford and shows sellers you're serious. It's free, and it puts you in a stronger position when you make an offer. I recommend doing this before you start touring homes.

## 2. Understand Your Down Payment Options

You don't always need 20% down. FHA loans allow as little as 3.5% down, and conventional programs can go as low as 3% for qualified buyers. There are also down payment assistance programs for first-time buyers in California. We can review what fits your situation.

## 3. Budget Beyond the Mortgage

Your monthly payment isn't just principal and interest. Factor in property taxes, insurance, HOA fees (if applicable), and maintenance. In SoCal, property taxes and insurance can add a meaningful amount—so plan accordingly.

## 4. Work With a Local Advisor

Rates and programs can vary. A local mortgage advisor who knows the Southern California market can help you choose the right loan, avoid delays, and close on time. I work with first-time buyers every day and keep the process clear and stress-free.

## 5. Don't Make Big Financial Changes Before Closing

Once you're under contract, avoid opening new credit cards, making large purchases, or changing jobs if possible. Lenders re-verify your financial picture before funding, and big changes can complicate or delay your closing.
