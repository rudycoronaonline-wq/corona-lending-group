Pre-approval is your first real step toward buying a home. Here's how it works in three steps.

## Step 1: Gather Your Documents

Have these ready: ID, recent pay stubs (or proof of income if self-employed), 2 months of bank statements, and last 2 years of tax returns. If you have other assets or debts, we'll go over what's needed. The goal is to give the lender a clear picture of your income, assets, and credit.

## Step 2: Apply and Get Your Credit Pulled

We'll complete an application and the lender will pull your credit. This is a "hard" inquiry but it's normal and expected. From this we get your credit score and debt-to-income ratio, which drive your loan amount and rate.

## Step 3: Receive Your Pre-Approval Letter

Once you're approved, you get a letter stating how much you can borrow (subject to property and final underwriting). You can use this when making offers—sellers and agents take you seriously because they know you're qualified.

Pre-approval is free and there's no obligation. Ready to get started? Book a free consultation and we'll get you pre-approved.
