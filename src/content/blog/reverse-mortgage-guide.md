Reverse mortgages let homeowners 62 and older access their home equity without monthly mortgage payments. Here's how they work and who they're for.

## The Basics

With a reverse mortgage (HECM—Home Equity Conversion Mortgage), you're not making monthly payments to the lender. Instead, the lender pays you—via a lump sum, line of credit, or monthly payments. You stay in your home; the loan is repaid when you sell, move out, or pass away.

## Who It's For

Reverse mortgages are designed for seniors who want to supplement retirement income, pay for healthcare, or eliminate a current mortgage payment while staying in their home. You must be 62+, live in the home as your primary residence, and have sufficient equity.

## Is It Safe?

Yes. HECMs are federally insured and regulated. There are costs (origination, insurance, servicing), and it's important to understand how the loan affects your equity and heirs. I walk every client through the details so you can decide with confidence.

## Next Step

If you're 62+ and curious whether a reverse mortgage could help you, we can review your situation in a free consultation—no obligation.
