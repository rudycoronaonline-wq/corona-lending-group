Being self-employed doesn't mean you can't get a great mortgage. Lenders have programs that use bank statements, profit-and-loss statements, and other docs instead of traditional W-2s.

## Why It's Different

Traditional underwriting relies on pay stubs and tax returns. Self-employed income can look "lumpy" or be written off for tax purposes, so we use programs that look at your actual cash flow and business health.

## What You'll Need

Common requirements include 12–24 months of bank statements, sometimes a profit-and-loss statement, and possibly tax returns. Exact requirements depend on the program. I'll tell you upfront what we need so there are no surprises.

## Rates and Terms

You can still get competitive rates. We shop multiple lenders and use programs designed for business owners and freelancers. Whether you're a sole proprietor or run an S-corp, we can find a fit.
